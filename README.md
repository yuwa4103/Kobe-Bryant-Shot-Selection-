# Kobe Bryant Shot Selection 
## Abstract 
Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest basketball players to have stepped onto a basketball court. He 
had God gifted basketball talents but nevertheless he believed in hard work and perfection. His talent 
and drive for greatness led him to a successful NBA career.  He is one of the few players to have come straight from highschool into the NBA. ​Bryant played his entire 20-season career in the ​National Basketball Association​ (NBA) with the ​Los Angeles Lakers​. Bryant is an 18-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA Team, and 12-time  All-Defensive team. In his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers he won 5 NBA championships.  Kobe Bryant died in a Helicopter Accident on January 26th, 2020. His sudden 
death broke so many hearts. As a group and individually, Kobe has played an indirect role in our lives. 
Kobe is a superstar. As a tribute to Kobe we wanted to utilize this project as an opportunity to showcase 
his greatness and what he meant to the basketball world.  
## Description 
His presence, impact and influence on and off the court contributed greatly to the revenue 
streams of both the NBA and LA. With that in mind, we decided to explore his shots selections and his 
shooting percentages and the impact of his shot selection on his ability to make shots. We will use data 
on all of his shots to determine which of his shots he made the most.  Our target variable will be shot 
made, with potential features being shot type - shot distance - position on court- time left in-game. 
Using this model, we will be able to predict the best shot types that a player can take to make his 
shooting more efficient. This will help us make recommendations for shot types and efficiency levels a 
player will have to perform in order to increase their salary potentially through a max contract. 
## Data 
Our Kobe Braynt data comes from Kaggle with 30697 rows and 25 columns. This data contains the 
location and circumstances of every field goal attempted by Kobe Bryant during his 20-year career. This 
data already removed 5000 of the shot_made_flags (represented as missing values in the csv file). These 
are the test set shots for which you must submit a prediction. Therefore the data did not require rigorous 
cleaning. This dataset contains information like playoffs, shot_distance, shot_type.etc which are pretty 
interesting.
